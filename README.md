# LPR
Project on Detecting and recognizing license plates in cars

## Description
The main goal of this project was to train an object detecion model to recognize where the number plates are located on cars and extract the characters on the plate. I did this to understand the techniques behind Real world, practical ALPR (Automatic License Plate Recognition). I used WPOD-net as the model to train along with OpenCV and Tesseract to identify, filter and extract the text needed for Optical Character Recognition. 

## What to install
Instal keras, opencv, tesseract, matplotlib, numpy and sklearn. WPOD-net's .h5 file can be downloaded from here: [WPOD-net link](https://github.com/quangnhat185/Plate_detect_and_recognize/blob/master/wpod-net.h5)

## How to run the project
There are detailed instructions given on how to train and run this project made by Quang Nguyen on his Medium article given here: [article link](https://medium.com/@quangnhatnguyenle/detect-and-recognize-vehicles-license-plate-with-machine-learning-and-python-part-3-recognize-be2eca1a9f12)
